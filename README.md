## ‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Overview
1. **User Input Module**  
   Collects payment/report parameters from user via PyQt dialogs.
2. **SAP Auxiliary Functions**  
   Handles navigation, data extraction and load data through SAP GUI scripting.
3. **Daily Payments**  
   Applies daily transactions into SAP based on bank movement files.
4. **Payments Module**  
   Categorizes different types of payments, processes detail files, and automates their entry into SAP.
5. **Reports Module**  
   Generates:
   - Aging debt reports
   - Annual balance sheets
   - Large retailer summaries
6. **Utilities Module**  
   Advanced Excel manipulation using `xlwings` and the powerful Excel COM API.
7. **Config Loader**  
   Loads SAP environment info from a secure JSON configuration file *(placeholders used to protect sensitive data).*
8. **Main Module**  
   Application entry point. Loads UI and enables module selection.
9. **SAP Info JSON**  
   Contains SAP codes, cost centers, company data, and template paths *(sensitive information withheld).*
